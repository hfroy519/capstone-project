## Introduction

A group of Americans from Chicago are moving to Amsterdam for work. None of them know anything about neighborhoods
in Amsterdam and are uncertain about which neighborhoods they may prefer. They do know which neighborhoods they prefer
in Chicago. They'd like to get a recommendation for which neighborhood in Amsterdam is most similar to each neighborhood in Chicago. 

In order to help the group make more informed decisions, I will use the four square data for each of the cities to retrieve venue
type data and calculate a Pearson Correlation for each neighborhood pair based on similarity of venue type.

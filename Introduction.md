## Introduction

A group of Americans from Chicago are moving to Amsterdam for work. None of them know anything about neighborhoods
in Amsterdam and are uncertain about which neighborhoods they may prefer. They do know which neighborhoods they prefer
in Chicago. They'd like to get a recommendation for which neighborhood in Amsterdam is most similar to each neighborhood in Chicago.

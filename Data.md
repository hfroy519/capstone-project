## Data

In order to help the group make more informed decisions, I will use the four square data for each of the cities to retrieve venue
type data by neighborhood. I will use this data to calculate a value for each neighborhood pair based on similarity of venue type. 
I will then return the Amsterdam neighborhood that is most similar to each Chicago neighborhood.
